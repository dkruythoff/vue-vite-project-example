# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite example scaffold

Basic project starter

## Design

`npm run storybook`  
Set up and compose components in Storybook.
TypeScript props facilitate feeding data structures into components and setting defaults in implementations.

## Implementation

`npm run dev`  
Set up data layer(s) and implement components created in Storybook. 
Actions can be set with either functions fed to component props, or event handlers set on component implementation. 
File based SPA navigation can be added with a Vite plugin. Nuxt does this by default.

## Building

`npm run build`  
Buid for production.

## Build preview

`npm run serve`  
Preview production build after building.
